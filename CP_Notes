<-- Xor Properties -->

 a ^ a = 0
 a ^ 0 = a


if a ^ b = c 
then a^c = b 
and  b^c = a

Euler Totient Properties

1. phi(m*n) = phi(m) * phi(n)
2. d occurs as gcd(i, N) exactly phi(N/d) times for each i form 1 to N
3. phi(n) repeats periodically 
ex: 
numbers that are coprime to 6 ( gcd(i, 6)=1 ) is,  
*1 2 3 4 *5 6 || *7 8 9 10 *11 12 || .......

4. For all d such that d|n , SUM(phi(d)) = n

5. For n > 2, phi(n) is always even. 
6. sum of integers that are coprime to n equals to (phi(n) * n)/2

Euler's Theorem :    a^phi(n) % n = 1  if a and n are co-prime. 
Fermat's Theorem:    a^(p-1) % p = 1  if a and p are co-prime and p is prime.

Existence of Modular Inverse
Modular Inverse of A with respect to M , that is X = A^-1  (mod M) exists if and only if A and M are coprime.

A^phi(M) = 1 (mod M) 
A^(phi(M)-1) = A^-1 (mod M) = X = Mod Inverse of A.
if M is prime then phi(M) = M - 1 
So A^(M-2) (mod M) = A^-1 (mod M) = X   (if and only if M is PRIME)
